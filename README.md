# AUV-modeling-and-sim
This submission contains the files used in this video on modeling, simulation and control of an Autonomous Underwater vehicle - &lt;Link TBD once video is live>. This submission models a 6-DoF autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a position and velocity controller for the AUV. You can switch between low and high fidelity sensor and environment models based on your application needs.

Aerospace Blockset is used to model the dynamics of the vehicle. To learn how to model the thrusters using system identification, watch this video - https://www.mathworks.com/videos/matlab-and-simulink-robotics-arena-from-data-to-model-1518156121608.html
